## Why You Need SortAnything

- **Cluttered folders slowing you down?**  
    If you’ve ever stared at a messy folder full of downloads, documents, or images, paralyzed by the thought of sorting it all, SortAnything simplifies the process. **Just select your files, set up your categories, and start sorting**—file by file, as fast as you can decide.
    
- **Ever wanted to assign files to folders just by pressing a key?**  
    With SortAnything, you can. Instead of dragging and dropping, **assign files on the fly with hotkeys or simple buttons**. Save time, reduce mistakes, and keep your focus on the content.
    
- **Need previews for images and text files before you sort?**  
    See what you’re moving before you move it. **Never accidentally shuffle the wrong file** into the wrong place again.
    
- **Want to pick up where you left off?**  
    Life happens. With **session management**, you can save your progress and return later—no need to start over from scratch.
    
- **Prefer to export your sorted list instead of moving actual files?**  
    Get your organized list as JSON, CSV, TXT, or HTML—perfect for reports, analysis, or sharing.

## How It Works

- **Choose Your Files:** Select from a folder, clipboard, CSV, or text file.
    
- **Set Up Your Categories:** Create up to 10 personalized buckets (categories) with unique names and colors. Make them fit your workflow.
    
- **Sort Fast:** Files appear one by one. Assign each to a category with a single key press or click.
    
- **Preview and Confirm:** See images and text file previews before you move anything.
    
- **Finish Your Way:** Move files to folders, or export your sorted list for other uses.
    
- **Save Your Progress:** Stop and restart your session anytime—no lost work, no hassle.
